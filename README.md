The Movie Trailer project consists of server-side code that lists my favorite 
movies in a static web page.   The user sees the movie poster for movie which 
can be clicked in order to see the movie trailer.

In order to run, you must run the python program entertainment_center.py

The html file created is fresh_tomatoes.html
